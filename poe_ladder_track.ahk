;
; Author's Note: I'm not an AHK programmer, I learned everything on the fly. There is a
; good chance this code will look sloppy to experienced AHK programmers, if you have any
; advice or would like to re-write it, please feel free and let me know. 
;
; USAGE NOTE: This requires your Path of Exile to be in Windowed (or Windowed Full Screen) 
; to work properly, otherwise the popup will just show in the background and you won't
; see it.
;
; CONFIGURATION NOTE: You must configure the variables below! Look for the Variables
;   section and change them appropriately - especially LeagueName and CharName!
;
; ===================================================
; General Information on Data Returned:
;
; Grinding Gear Games makes ladder information for the top 15,000 players available via a
; horribly clumsy API here: http://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/api-resource-ladders
;
; It's ridiculous because you have to make a ton of requests and can't pull information on 
; a specific character. To help players with this, I download the main league ladders
; every 6-8 minutes on my server and make specific information available via a better API
; here: http://poe.pwx.me/api/ladder
;
; This macro simply loads a web page from my server that uses my API to show a simple
; summary of ladder information for the chosen character.
;
; NOTE: It reloads the page on my server every 60s, but my server only updates from GGG every
; 6-8 minutes. Thus, you will only see the data change every 6-8min in the UI. Anything closer
; to realtime is impossible with GGG's current API.
;
; WEIRD THINGS SOMETIMES HAPPEN IN HARDCORE IF YOU DIE AND MAKE A NEW CHARACTER WITH THE
; SAME NAME!! I do my best but GGG doesn't make this easy. If at all possible I try to only
; display information for characters that are ALIVE.
;
; FINAL NOTE: It makes the IE refresh sound whenever it refreshes. This is annoying, I realize.
; I can apparently turn it off by doing some registry stuff but didn't mess with it.
;
; == Startup Options ===========================================
